# To-Do List

To-Do List is the flagship vanilla JS project, it works by adding a title, description, priority and date!


## Funcionalities

- Add, Edit and Delete a Task!
- Create and Delete Projects!
- Filter tasks by specific projects!
- Save your tasks and refresh the page with the "save" button! (this works locally)


## Practiced Skills
This project really highlighted a common usage of OOP and gave me an opportunity to practice S.O.L.I.D principles, with an emphasis on Single responsability! Saving the tasks on different projects was also an interesting way of using the array data structure to my advantage!
